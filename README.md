# Throttle Project

This exercise project is a system for throttling the execution of asynchronous functions in TypeScript.

## Program Rules

1. You have an array called `load` with 50 positions, which are asynchronous functions that simulate a workload through a delay.
2. You must execute ALL workloads (none should be left unexecuted).
3. Each worker (parallel execution position) should only execute one task at a time.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/throttle-project.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```
cd throttle-project npm install
```

3. Run the development script:
```
npm run dev
```

4. Lint the code:
```
npm run lint
```
